# ReactionDiffusion
A playground for reaction-diffusion systems and pattern formation

There are two notebooks looking at pattern formation using Reaction-Diffusion PDEs. Both notebooks extend existing tutorials to study the Gray-Scott equations.

For a refresher on the Gray-Scott equation, check out the graphical [intro](http://www.karlsims.com/rd.html) by digital media artist Karl Sims (worth taking a peak at some of his projects). As well, a great place to explore the world of the the Gray-Scott equation is Robert Munafo's [xmorphia page]( https://mrob.com/pub/comp/xmorphia/).

For reference:
The first notebook, ```Reaction-Diffusion.ipynb```, follows Cyrille Rossan's demo in the [iPython cookbook section 12.4](https://ipython-books.github.io/124-simulating-a-partial-differential-equation-reaction-diffusion-systems-and-turing-patterns/). The second notebook, ```TF_ReactionDiffusion.ipynb```, looks at speeding things up using [TensorFlow with PDEs](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/non-ml/pdes).
